I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases Unit at Institut Pasteur. I have worked on the transmission of West Nile virus in Algeria and the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 in France and the world.
Previously, I was a **Prevention Effectiveness Fellow** (Analytics and Modeling Track) in the Poxvirus and Rabies Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Before that, I was a **PhD student** at Imperial College London under the supervision of Christl Donnelly and Pierre Nouvellet, an MPH student at the University of Michigan, 
and an undergraduate student at Madonna University. I like doing science outreach, learning languages, and training in Olympic weightlifting.
